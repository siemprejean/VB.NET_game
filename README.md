# VB.NET_game
These repository contains my VB.NET game
This game was made as a project for college, starts with a small presentation as you can see, the button "jugar" is to play the game, which is based in a spacecraft. You need to collect the trash across the space, the trash goes at a certain speed and collides with the border of the screen, same for the asteroid. Each time you are hitten by an asteroid or you crasha agaisnt the platform you lose a life once you lose all your lives is game over. In order to make some progress you need to pick up some trash and deliver it to the platform, if you go too fast you will crash and die too. The spacecraft moves each time you press the arrow buttons, each press increases the speed up to a limit, in order to decrease it you need to press any other arrow. The lives, speed and score are all on the screen for you to see.
